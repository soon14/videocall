Program flow:

Landing page:
    - Create room redirects user to url with roomId generated by server.
    - Join room redirects user to url with already existing roomId, or lets him
        know that the room does not exist.

Room page:
    - Request video and audio stream from user.
    - If agreed by user, establish websocket connection.
    - Server gives user an unique username.
    - User gives server the room it is trying to join.
    - Server stores user and adds him to participant list of the room.
    - Server broadcasts message to rest of the room the let them know someone has joined.
    - Other participants send new user a video-offer.
    - The rest is as described in https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Signaling_and_video_calling.

Hang up:
    - User sends hang-up message to server, and navigates to landing page.
    - Server broadcasts the message to the other participants in the room.
    - Every participant removes its video html-element for that user,
        and removes the RTCPeerConnection from its list.
